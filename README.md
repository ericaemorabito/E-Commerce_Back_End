# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

## Description

This project built the back end for an e-commerce site. I created a working Express.js API and configured it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

- This project allows a user to interact with a database.
- I built this project to connect an Express.js API with a MySQL database.
- This API helps someone interact with the database.
- I learnt more about Express.js routes and database manipulation.

## Installation

- Clone [this repo](https://github.com/ericaemorabito/E-Commerce_Back_End.git).
- Open MySQL shell.
- Source schema.sql file.
- Close MySQL shell.
- Open terminal.
- Run npm run seed.
- Run npm run start.
- Use API routes to interact with the data.

In order to use this project, you must source the schema.sql file and seed the database with the command npm run seed. Then, you are able to run npm run start in the terminal and begin using the API routes.
